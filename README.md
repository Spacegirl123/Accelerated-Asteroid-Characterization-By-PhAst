# **Accelerated-Asteroid-Characterization-By-PhAst**
### The pace of asteroid discovery surpasses the rate at which their physical properties can be analyzed. To date, phase curves, which are crucial for asteroid characterization, have been generated for a few thousand of the 1.3 million known asteroids as they necessitate observations from multiple phase angles over several years. This hinders our planetary defense capabilities against near-Earth asteroids and limits our understanding of the solar system’s evolution. My novel methodology PhAst combines several years of sparse photometry of serendipitous asteroid observations from ground and space-based all-sky surveys with dense photometry from professional and citizen scientists. The algorithm generates phase curves whose linear component yields the asteroid’s geometric albedo and composition while the non-linear brightness surge at small angles determines the absolute magnitude. This allows the creation of folded lightcurves to measure the asteroid’s rotation period and, for binary asteroids, their mutual orbital period. 
### This repository contains a 5-part training module focused on understanding asteroid physical properties using the PhAst method. It includes detailed tutorials and practical exercises to help users learn how to generate phase curves and measure important characteristics like brightness, composition, and rotation periods of asteroids. This training is designed to support both professional and amateur astronomers in learning more about near-Earth asteroids and aiding planetary defense efforts.
